# Phase 0 Characterization Tests

These checks capture the CLI/Core behavior before reduction. They use existing repository tests where those tests already provide deterministic coverage.

| Contract                                  | Test or check                                              | Network mode                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Configuration parsing                     | `packages/config-yaml/src/__tests__/index.test.ts`         | In-memory registry and local fixtures |
| Core initialization and adapter selection | `extensions/cli/src/services/ModelService.test.ts`         | Mocked API factory                    |
| Controlled non-editor workflow            | `extensions/cli/src/e2e/headless-mock-llm.test.ts`         | Local HTTP fixture                    |
| Adapter normalization                     | `packages/openai-adapters/src/apis/Anthropic.test.ts`      | No network                            |
| CLI invocation                            | `extensions/cli/smoke-test.mjs` and the headless mock test | No network or local HTTP fixture      |
| Core public import                        | Export-state inventory; unavailable at baseline            | Not applicable                        |
| Static and emitted boundary               | `node tests/characterization/boundary-check.mjs`           | No network                            |
| Runtime boundary                          | `node tests/characterization/runtime-boundary-check.mjs`   | No network                            |

The boundary checks treat existing CLI-to-Core deep imports as observed baseline evidence. They fail only when Core or the emitted/runtime CLI closure crosses the named prohibited repository boundaries.
